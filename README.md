Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value and the right child has a value greater than the node’s value. This property is called the BST property and it makes it possible to efficiently search, insert, and delete elements in the tree.

# Heap

A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.
